## Behind the Idea

For the past few years, I have noticed a shift in employment. In Order for these tiny digital businesses to go out and thrive, they need to have certain tasks done. They do not want to go out and hire someone full time, inteview 12 people and get two good ones. They want to be able to pay a prive to get something done. I give you money, you fix my problem. Some companies take this in a few odd ways.

The proposed way that I think business should run is you can work for me on a project basis. I have somethings I need done, you have the time and interest and its makes you happy, I am happy to pay you for them. If you see something I want done and hate the price, thats fine, I will either never get it doen or pay you a price that is worth it to the both of us.

Two way bidding for projects.

### User Stories

As a user, I should be able to login and create a project. A project wil have many tasks. Each task has a price, description, time, priority, flexiility. The user then makes the bid and is given a schedule for a 15/30 minute call with the person who posted then job.
